1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software\
*Understanding the purpose of the software.*
* * *
2. The Goals of Software Design\
*if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short.*
* * *
3. (Mis)understanding\
*Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.*
* * *
4. Simplicity\
*A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs.*
* * *
5. Complexity\
*How did you become a victim of this horror story? Nah, who cares. It’s better to ask: How could you avoid being a victim?*
* * *
6. Maintenance\
*Thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.*
* * *
7. Consistency\
*If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place.*
* * *
8. Prioritizing\
*The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.*
* * *
9. Solving Problems\
*The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them*
* * *
10. Good enough is fine\
*Whether creating a new project or adding a feature to existing system developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning.*
* * *
11. Predictions\
*Being too generic involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.
Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.*
* * *
12. Assumptions\
*Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. *
* * *
13. Stop Reinventing\
*Don’t reinvent the wheel (don't work on the things already exists)*
* * *
14. Resistance\
*Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.*
* * *
15. Automation\
*If you can automate it, automate it.*
* * *
16. Code measurement\
*The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.*
* * *
17. Productivity\
*Your main goal should be keeping your code base meets the goal and as small as possible.*
* * *
18. Testing\
*Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.*
* * *
19. Estimation\
*Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.*
PS: Everything takes longer than you think.
* * *
20. Running Away From Rewriting\
Refactoring should be the first option.
* * *
21. Documentation and Commenting\
*It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and components.*
* * *
22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)\
*Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.*
* * *
23. Self-Development\
*Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.*
* * *
24. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help\
*Don’t ask others how to do, at least not immediately. try anything and everything you can think of.*
* * *
